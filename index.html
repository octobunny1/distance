its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
“To love without condition, to talk without intention,
to give without reason, care without expectation,
“Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
“It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
“If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
“Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
"If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
“A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
“There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
“I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
“I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
“Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
“The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
“Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
“Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>

konichiwa Mitsuha chan ^-^<br>

<i>*What you feel in your heart? What you mean?</i><br>
before i answer this question, i want to know something from you. so, tell me how you feel when you open the letter i send to you by penom<br>
i don't know still you get the answer or not, in my words that feel is something like, a warm feel in heart times whenever i think of you, after a little pray to god from soul for you to be safe without even noticing.<br>
it kind of feel like whenever a girl approach near to me it push me back a step to be in my boundaries, <br>
a kind of feel, even after seeing couple around still bring a smile from inside to keep remind my always beside me in soul , a magical feel can't be expressed in words.<br>
a kind of feel, when about to feel tired and hard about studies it made me remeber and say the amound of time waste you do now is the amound of time disneyland trip moving forward.<br>
the feel, it always say to live a truthful life even the world around is rotten, being pure is just a self gifted wish amd a lot more which can't be expressed in words. and in more time made us understand how beautiful it is...<br>
<br>
<i>*Okay then let me see how you will earn my trust!☠️</i><br>
i guess i don't need to do anything special/magical to earn your trust, just like all the time going in a right path is good ^-^<br><br>
<i>* I don't think I can be a motivator for anyone, I am just interested in earning some handful of money with 50% of profit 🤷🏻‍♀️</i><br>
you know what, we dont know what our actions do sometimes, like sometimes its a normal thing for us to do but in some mind it just a goden shine to wake up and to start to move toward dreams<br>
example: did i said you this? after i show off a guy name 'pavan' my senior become friend with me and he one who started walk with me in college route from few days one day he said he inspired by me a lot and purchased a laptop to start to build his core skills, best part he stopped caring about girls around him😂😂😂 still asking me how to be in selfcontrol😂😂<br>
i lost my mind after this just like you not knowing that you inspired and motivated me without even knowing, so in theory you the one who motivated this guy 🤔🤔🤔 youre the one who behind everything ...<br>
potato chan... you are my hero, my sweet potato 😋<br><br>
<i>*Maybe you getting sick because you bath after  you go home after the full day of hardwork, so do a thing,

            <hr>
        <i>*Hey , you know what there are so many things left to let you know about my current life situation which going on ..... 
            Remember after navratri I wasn't texting for more few days it was because 
            I went on family with my parents, we went to Assam and Mahalaya by car, and came home at 31st October</i><br>
            ohh wow, i guess it might a little refreshment for you, at navarathri time i thought due to daily pooja and all you didn' got time to text.<br>
            and the things, say me when possible and as long as you are safe and happly thats a happy thing for me...<br>
            <br>

            <i>*You see this same in one year only we went to oddisa at March and Assam and Mahalaya at October, from small I have been traveling 80% of India's beauty I have seen .. now only few places left and some of the places I want to revisit with you like (Kashmir, Andaman, Mumbai, etc) it would be so much fun isn't it!
                And the whole world is left , hehe</i><br>
                sure😊 im definitely ready to roam all the places with you, its so  fun and lot more unexpressable. sure lets revisit the places what you want to, and there i can get a non stop adorable speaker who explain everything to me isn't it<br><br>

                <i>*By the way I just checked out you YouTube channel, you have so less viewers and almost no likes , I have and I idea for you channel to go famous you have to do some changes, wait let me write and then explain you , ok ? Will you do it as I say about your YouTube channel? And don't get offended it I say anything ok!</i>
<br>
for now this channel is only for you and i planning if i get chance i'll try to make content again, and happy to know i gonna get suggestion and all from you ^-^<br>
im waiting for you to say and oii dont rush take your time its not an emergency<br>
<br>
<i>*By the way your videos are prove enough that those pictures were take by you .. you have a great voice but you need to work on you accent and pronunciation ok ! I like the way you speak tho!</i><br>
arigato <br>
oi you know actually while im filming there are so many people out there, aside reels making candidated, commenting guys, in between all shy candy me.,, huh.. moreover i manage to made video out of shyness in public in day time with voice for the first time to show you, from next i'll try better<br><br>

<i>*Your transformation is so cool like really looking so handsome (it is more like 🔥 hot) but I liked you even before the transformation you know. Your determination and improvement is mind blowing. Keep it up. I will cheer for you . I WISH I COULD BE LIKE YOU 🥺
    Kakkoi !</i>
<br>
arigato im going shy over and over by your words 👉👈   <br>
oiii why to be like me when i love you a lot lot more when you are the way you are, you are my lucky charm ^-^<br>and you know what you are the best always its you<br>
love yourself, be yourself. the way you are, the most most beautiful and precious thing to me in the world<br>
My lucky charm<br> you are the best always<br><br>

<i>*I still don't believe it you are so much better than me, such so amazing person and you treat me so kindly the way I always want to feel valued 😭 why would you even like or love a person like me. I am so immature, no time sense, I don't understand what people want, always disturb them, oh ! Am not even that is preety, I've health issues. I am no where near perfect .  You don't even know why you love me .. what the fish is in water! 
    Sometimes my existence becomes a question.</i><br>
    for you it might be this way, but when come to me, you aren't an choice. i always feel and see you like you are the option exist in life for me, im heartfully thank everyday god while praying you to be safe happy and healthy...<br>
    you saying perfect,  so tell me what made you imperfect, if you ask me about perfection, i will say perfect word is a lie,<br>
    you aren't immature, you mature more enough to be a wise women, you are just childish, my cute little kid. and i love the way you things so much<br>
    why health issue a reason to not love a person, if you have health i'll take care of you like my own daughter, i guess those may be a way god put to make more love and understanding between each other in some cases. i still remember the day seeing you hand that way out of patches, that time what i wished god is, 'please make her healthy and happy , i'll do fasting for every saturday, as long as i could' 👉👈 this is one of reason why i refuse to agree to you when you said "dont do fasing in october"<br>
    you know what sometimes my thoughts goes like this, do my mom need to have a reason to love me, does he have any reason to love me unconditionally, then i asked the same toward me., i understood loving without expecting anything might be the happiest things ever to soul in this world.<br><br><br>

    <i>*Plus the things my perents said about stupid female being trapped by male all over the country and the sale them and use them to earn like pros etc ..... 
         The cruel world, so you know what I am actually afraid of. Oh I feel weird.. but I still have this strong feeling for you  
         some what I feel you are perfect and true huMan being .
        * never mind whatever  I said . Sorry, if you upset or offended.. Gomen ne🙇🏻‍♀️</i><br>
        arey stupid why to say sorry, did i ever get upset by you, you have all the rights to question me straight, and i should definitely answer you.<br>
        sometimes im feel so happy that your parents teach you things which make aware to go outside, cz this world really messed up, where my side few week back an incident about a girl i said you, their parents leave her to her freedom not caring much, she started being fiends with her school boys, but things went wrong. the four of her friends whom she trust killed her cruelly that so painful to say<br>
        im so glad about this with your parents, in other words its a luck, in  some of their behaviour its not.<br>
        whatover i wish and pray you to be always safe,<br>
        please be safe at outside, <br>
        huh!!! you know sometimes i feel to bite you when you say things like, stop acting kind, -_-<br>
        remeber this, if you attempt to say this when im infront of you, i dont know where i bite you, i dont gonna show any hetisation. after you question 😅😅😅<br><br>
        so keep in mind and be cafeful ok...<br>
        <br>

     <i>By the way are you still afraid of losing me?</i><br>
     
Back in days it is a strongly "Yes", once what happened in July I went to a stage I can't define before sending you the letter. I started reading Bible and there i saw a lines saying 
" Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails." - St Paul (1 Corinthians 13:4-7)"
<br>
Luke 6:31: Do to others as you would have them do to you. Corinthians 16:14: Do everything in love.
<br>
Proverbs 3:3-4: Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
<br>
Romans 12:10: Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.

<br>
1 Peter 3:7: In the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life. Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.
<br>
2 Peter 1:5-7: For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.
<br>
1 Thessalonians 3:12: May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.
<br>

Proverbs 10:12: Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.
<br>
1 Peter 4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins
<br>
Corinthians 13:13: And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
<br>
Romans 12:9: Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
<br>
Colossians 3:14: And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
<br>
Ephesians 4:2: Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.
<br>
Jude 1:2: Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
<br>
John 13:34: A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
<br>
Song of Solomon 4:7: You are altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you
<br>
Hebrews 10:24-25: And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the day approaching.
<br>
While i read these i started to understand after reading this line :
if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” Matthew 17:20-21.1
<br>
I start to have faith, huh at first I doubt it is it really then I understood by the history these were written in thousands years ago in different time lines (hundreds of years) different continents different languages. In deep clear by God through these people it resulted a Bible these each person who wrote each chapter, are got healed from dark past by having faith in God then got choosen by God.
<br>
From that time when I loose mind..... There i start reading and having faith in what i prayed. 
<br>
You know what, there is this person she's like a sister to my mother around end of June she gave birth to a baby. Me went to visit later a little play with the baby boy, I asked for a pic but she refuse. A little after she said this " while about 6th months doctors said it's impossible for the baby to have a life, uncle and she started to pray for the baby life and holding faith. Later she gave birth to a healthy boy.  She said the whole with tears. From that time I start to have strong belief and faith. And start to pray for you to be safe and happy all the time. From that i start not afraid of loosing what i actually understood is, while having faith having doubts is totally something like loosing faith by self. In something simply what I can explain or what i wanna say in simple to you is, "even having a true little faith in God without doubt can bring the things we need from God when I done by heartfullly by us."
I don't know what you understood, If i said anything wrong forgive me, 🙄 I think I wrote another to explain you... But still it's a little i said on times I will say you a lot lot more..
<br>
And even more in bedtime stories my cute sweet little princess 😊
<br>
If I may i would like to say, after reading the question there i feel something feared in while i cool down myself, cz when I believe that i may go anyfar to not to loose you. And as long as we believe and have faith, nothing will seperate us. 
<br>

Listen carefully 🧐🧐🧐<br>
🧐If think of asking this question again, keep in mind I'm gonna bite you as many times as you asked me the question,,, understood 🧐🧐🧐🧐..<br>
I always love to bite you 😋😋😋
            <br><br>
            🙄🙄🙄 gomen gomen<br>
            this ... this i wrote another hard for you to read 🙄<br>
            sorrry<br>
            i guess it would better for me to turn off and sleep cz clock is going to 11:30PM<br>
            so Good night my princess😊, my cute little stupid princess, requestion and wishing you to be careful and safe all the time.<br>
            sleep well and come in my dream and sit beside me look into my eyes and say all things, i would like to stay like the way listening to you😊<br>
            i always love to listen to you<br>
            in more always love you more more and more always my princess😊<br>
            <br>
