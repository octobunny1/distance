its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
“To love without condition, to talk without intention,
to give without reason, care without expectation,
“Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
“It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
“If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
“Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
"If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
“A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
“There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
“I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
“I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
“Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
“The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
“Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
“Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>

keeping it aside just after that i need to submit few previous certificates at college i went to old college to get them and after getting new phone i understood my Mobile balance also end with phone.
<br>
and i bought this phone <br>
Tecno Pova 5pro 5G (black color)<br>

i tried mybest to wait till for you to buy, huh !!! but the previos one couldn't even stand a chance <br>
the real struggle here, the page i we use, all acess codes for that are endup in this phone and your songs also, rather getting panic, hardly i found a way to get back all data i need form it finally now i come to receive your message and i saw all now im gonna answer each...<br><br>
<br>
<i> *After all you are different then me , i guess I am making the situation worst.. 
    oi you know that I like you and i care for you but.. but i can't leave my religion it will be uncomfortable.. 
    please sorry ok , please</i><br>
    if you dont mind let me know what make you think like that<br>
im still thinking what you understood from that, and did i ever said/asked you to change religion...?<br>
oii dont say sorry ok, you didnt done any wrong, as i saying from start, when i said "i love you" to you i mean i love the complete of you, sometimes you keep saying things like "why me...?" , <br>
you know what, "i always love you" because i love you always... because it would be impossible to not to love you, i love you without doubt or question, or even without calculation mostly without reason, good or bad, i loved you faithfully with all my heart and soul and every of my mine fractually"<br>
not expecting you to chance yourself, i love you how you are, i love the way you are, but still didn't find where i asked you to change your religiion, its our life our rules why to let some unknow from past make it uncomfortable,<br>
<br>
 i didnt find any best reason then this to answer you question about "reason to love you", you know what still i didnt find the reason<br><br>

<i> Do you know after marriage the wife have to adapt whatever the husband religion is, 
    and I don't want to be a traitor to my culture religion :(</i><br>
huuh!! who said that wife have to be adopt religion of husband after marriage im hearing this first time. 
i still confused , like these religions i think you forgot what our thoughts in this back in days. in life why cant it possible to respect each other on their loved things. for what we love<br><br><br>

<i> And form August after my perents found out about you they didn't like the matter and my father said he will break off the relation, 
    AND IF ONCE WHO LOSES BIRTH PERENTS THEY BECOME AN ORPHAN. I don't want to be one they did a lot for me , 
    i know sometimes or even more they were wrong but i can't hurt them. I can't see them cry because of me. </i><br>

arey my potato did you put your potato brain in fridge or somewhere at himalaya caves ahhh?<br>
huh!! i still remeber this, your stupidity said a time " i want to leave this place and cut all relations and become budha", when i said "its not a good to leave parents we are only for them at their old times"<br>
😑😑😑 what you said that time to me "ohhh so you are my parents side you only supporting them not me 😑.. and so much you said  " 😑😑😑<br>
now what, did any budha tree's fruit fell on head 😑 stupid, <br>
you're lucky that im not near you when i come to read this, if i were there i may tie you hands tight and bite you for a 1000 times and more 😑 stupid,<br>
i always want your father to be a good friend to me, and i will try mybest to be his best friend when i come to him for us, <br>
huh and aunt i dont what she gonna do in initaial, 🤔 no need to get surprice if she punch on my face... i will try to wear a hemet on when i first meet you mother 😅<br>
in end what more being beautiful than a being a lovey friendly family...<br><br>


<i>*And you know right that these holy books of different cultures are written by a human only. 
    And the God itself is a believe a light of hope and way of right and love of life. 
    But different people cherish it in different way by calling~ Provo ; God father/mother ; Allah ; kamisama .. etc. 
    I guess you know the birth place of each religion then you might even be knowing how it spreads all-over the world. 
    Know your ancestors you will get to know many things. ALL WRITTEN WORDS ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. 
    i am not judging but few things written in holy books like Bhagvat Gita or Bible few things written doesn't feel right, 
    this is not my doubt this is something feel that one will get who have the same mind set as me . </i><br>
    youre right and i completely agree with you, where in previous what i said to you is not what you thing, i try to something like what i hear what i saw and so.on...<br>
    it eighter write or wrong we can't judge but taking good from everything doent a hard thing i guess, what thing came from history it may not be necessary to go with all, but few by golden ink what tell how to be a true person , wise, kind and a lot to get in good, and other side also exist to leave what not helpful and evening not good to go with<br>
    just as you used to say me like teaching me good things and giving orders 😊 in back in days or even still what i follow all the time...<br><br>



<i>*See, we should never disrespect anyone or anyones choice or else the universe will be disrespect.</i><br>
i guess u completely understood what you said, and what you said is completely right, and some times i thought like its not a thing to talk like so, cz few exist like it not to talk like that my potato brain not getting it correct i will explain clearly when i get it<br><br>




<i>* And love is something undefined, it can't be measured but ot some point we do it and this four letter word carries so much of much and different people have different point of view about everything but few matches with each. </i><br>
yes you're always correct and it goes like roaming around knowledge boundaries set to each individuals, and when come to love it something that sometimes show high and low at same time, at very start it said to be unconditinal from mother cz you know it right mother love their child without a condition/reason and where it become un-measurable. 
<br><br>


<hr><br>

<i>Hey please don't get offended by what I said in last message 😞 I am so sorry
    Gomen ne kudasai 🙇🏻‍♀️</i><br>
    My lovely stupid potato, i always love to understand you, sometimes you become someone else 🤔 i guess i need to bite each time to get my girl back to normal,<br>
    oiii if you still wanna say sorry why cant you... give a long K instead of it 👉👈<br>
    it would be more beautiful isn't it? ^-^<br><br>

    <i>*Even I do want to lose you but what if things went wrong just because of our differences of religion and language, 
        then what will I do I will have no where to go and no where to be. 
        You know I have already been cheated many times and for being love blind I even risked everything.. 
        I am ready to risk everything again but am afraid that what if even this one is my another mistake..</i><br>
        bad bad -_- read the first line<br>
        huh!!! i confirmed it now, oiii got get your brain from the fridge 🤦‍♂️ , <br>
        i wish and i want to make you all the time to where you can able to come out of all the tarumas and come out from the stucked past,i will try my best to deliver my love to you till my end<br> 
        for now please be safe and mindful, and confidence, beliefs, fears , faith... each of things itself hold its strength, and did you remeber what once i said, whatever be believe put it action that gonna be achieve<br>
        i dont know you stoped that scratch completely or not, but just see isn't shown the result once after having faith and action on beliefs,<br>
        didn't you studied or known about " mind universe and frequency" if not i will explain when i got time for now a little example,<br> to understand universe we need to see in frequency like few frequency even cure cancer and patient need to be strong minded. with doubt fear mind cancer wouldn't be cured - from medical and science it proven it might a science book if i keep goin<br>
        in simply being doubtful instead of confidence is the first step fail... like doing without expectation in end what result can ruin the mind haaah again im going to teach you science class,, oiii try to make me remeber later ok i'll explain clear that time<br>
        <br>i dont need your sorry instead i want a long k each time i remeber it 😋 😋 😋 😋 <br><br>

        <i>* If my and your story is true then I will be happiest and luckiest person on this planet because you are so very perfect.. 
            A girl is lucky when her boy prays for her, work hard for her, listens to her, 
            love her like she have never been loved before and be with her no matter what, 
            last but not the list dreams with her to make it come true, a family, a world, two souls one life <3 then it is like a fantasy😌</i><br>
               i want to change "if"  to "Tomato", <br> and you making me go shy and making me blush hard withour words 👉👈...<br>
                youre always my lucky charm, and 🙄 i feel even more happy luckiest person if i get 👉👈 all the K i wish <br>👉👈...👉👈....👉👈

                "its even more beautiful than what i think a fantasy once"<br>
<br><br>

<i>*You are a smooth talker to me , from the very beginning you have been inspiring me and now you are my role model 
    because you are bringing such transformation in less time span. You really are incredible

<i>*Ok os as you want to know how I felt by the letter you send by you, 
    I actually don't have any words to explain because I never felt that way before, 
    I kinda feel this warmth from inside that someone cares and putting an effort to contact me. 
    I still kept that print out of your handwritten note and I like those short forms . 
    I got goosebumps when I realised it was from you. I was having geography class that time so before mam entered I ran to washroom. 
    I read it then I started to cry 🙄 then I went to pee and I got lock in one of the toilet, 
    door was not opening I started screaming one mam came and few care taker came they barche open the door by kicking. 
    I came out to find it was an hilarious moment but I was not in a mood to laugh -_- why do such things happen to me only. 
    So ya this was my experience with your letter.</i><br>
    i can feel and understand the movement when you get the letter, you know what i planned a whole 3 days straight to send you. in one possible way i found
     penzom the pegion, hehe then after i reach her i asked like a favour then she agree later, -_- but she called me dump junior, while after you got letter i asked penzom-sis how it went she said after the letter riya ran to washroom <br>
     at this movement i start to get tears and laugh at the same time. who the ... locked the door when you are in, still it became hilarious , it something different..<br>
     and i love the way you keep the letter by laminating it with hand.<br>
     <br><br>

     <i>*Woh that is crazy, I didn't knew I motivate this many people.. but you motivated me when I started talking to you. 
        And the way you are improving through studies, manners, physically is so amazing that you are my Role Model, and I truly mean it </i><br>
        i dont know i may motivated or not, and all the time i want to help you push forwards your limits and with your will i saw possible results now it is in your hand to stand with your mind potential<br>
        i still dont know how im role modes, if i answer i like to say in love everything is possible, and just take a look on things , <br>
        i know that youre the best, i always proud of your will, and i belive you can do well.<br><br><br>

        <i>*my specs broke because I sat on it by mistake, what is eye exercises ? </i><br>
        arey potato be careful maa, see when come to eye exercises<br>
        - lye on bed and rotate eyes to edges of corner ceiling of the room.<br>

        - after woke up rotate eyes to corneres and see through possible edge of eyes <br>
        - rest you know mainly water, then there a need of sunlight to warm the eye covered acids to help it well<br><br><br>

        <i>*Oh 17th February 2023 .. so when did I texted you for the Frist time, say me the date and time?

honey... im home...<br><br>
hey...! sorry for hiding this from you😔<br>
i dont wanna keep hide it from you, cz im afraid, if i come to start hiding things like this even i cant leave it even once i afraid where it maybe a habit <br>
forgive me for hiding this from you,<br>
while we talking recent night again i went to silent while saying few things<br>
while you saying about someone cried for you 🙄 it something little bothered me even it in past, a little and im i dont know how to say and express when im low. even in day to day life im something dont like others to show simpathy on me, 🙄 i feel so embraced of it<br>
it is one of reason i said no while you ask me for pics in communication notes, i feel so embrace and uncomfortable when someone see my tears<br>
but i opned my eyes, that you aren't a someone else, you the one i wanna spend my rest of my life, only one asked me say what i feel without hiding<br>
🙄 when i remeber you said "dont hide anything from me", it start bothering me like "to myself: you start hiding, and making excuse as it is  only one time. who know what you may hide further" like wise<br>
and you know why i keep say i wouldn't allow other girl to come near me, would talk or try to be friend with other girl. <br>
cz 👉👈 i know something how it feel 🙄 and i dont want you to feel that because of my actions, <br>sorry if i said anywrong 🙄 i dont want to hide this anymore not even this i dont wanna hide anything from you in further also.<br>
i dont want my action be the reason for my girl to overthink or get bothered <br> all the time i want to give you more and more once i expected, i wanna give you the unconditional love like the children get once after birth, i wanna be loyal to you more than i can to where you forget what it really mean by betrayal<br>
i wanna see you more mental strong healthy having peace joy and happy all the time<br><br>
forgive me if i said anything wrong, cz i start saying direct after i reached home. 🙄<br>
now going to bath  👉👈 see you around<br><br>
