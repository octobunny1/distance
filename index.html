its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
“To love without condition, to talk without intention,
to give without reason, care without expectation,
“Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
“It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
“If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
“Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
"If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
“A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
“There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
“I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
“I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
“Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
“The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
“Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
“Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>

<br>
<br>sorry little late due to some factors<br>
<i>* hey you have stopped writing to me daily? </i><br>
sorry actually on 5th october uncle came and same day my internet plan got over. 6th amamma went to uncle's house and im home alone i came to amma, 
but here i left my laptop there cz i came direct from college and amamma said, its something shanti pooja for grandfather so not allowed to go into house for 3days 3nights 
in addition all my programming data and everything in laptop and laptop at amamma's home today evening i went after college and bring laptop here around 7PM.
<br>
and today i got my recharge and the exams and project also completed yeasterday<br><br>

<i>Or you forgot about me or you are losing interest or you give up or you got someone new ?</i><br>
....but...😒😒😒<br>
you really asking such questions for real<br>
😑😑 bad girl bad bad stupid<br>
giving up is never an option to me, don't you know it?<br>
someone new..? huh i have no idea what made you think like this<br>
you know i didn't said you, that i cried that day night where i talked to that girl for reason why i talked to girls from my college, i felt embrasment and shy to say you that.
 i don't know but it bother me a lot just because of talking to some girl other than, then tell me what made you think im loosing intrest and running for someone, if something like that i rather choose to die.<br>
 and even after that day a senior sister gave that girl a warning also and there the issue and rest ended<br>
 after project i again into my anti-social. i dont how many time i said you these, but still i can heartfully say it... no other girl can get my attention, no other girl can enter my mind, no  girl can replace you.<br>
 getting someone new is never gonna happen, cz<br>
 its literally like loosing myself and my character<br>
 its a disrespect to my mom and my women<br>
 if something like that, what about my promises. did i lie to myself?<br>
 giving up on us is never an option, each time i prayed god i always god to be center of us and made nothing seperate us. then how can i even get a thought of giving up or someone new...<br>
 and mostly, you always been like a only option in my heart and mind.<br>
 did i ever treat you as an option..?<br><br>
till and to end even after end you are the only one i want in life puja, youre the only one all the time i asked god for, i always loving you more and more from the bottom of my heart<br><br>

<i>* I can't use the study took that way , because I am not allowed to make any account not I am allowed to download any app (I don't have phone of my own)</i><br>
its not a problem im planning to start a new project only for study if i sucess in it you will have chance to use it before board, for now i'll try to find best tool for study out there which dont need an account<br><br>

<i>*Today it's is 8october your exams finished yesterday so how was it ? And are you fine?</i><br>
today 10th exams finished on 9th yester and project and all done today, exams are well but after came here to home i have my book at amamma home so last 3exams are not well due to internet and lack of study resource still i tried my best<br>

oii and did you started your medicine course and how is your health now???<br><br>

<i>#reply to 4 October
    *Oh! You say like Alas in you won style, nice one ...but do you mean it!</i><br>
    if i didn't mean it, then what is my need to say those,<br>
    see whatever i say to God, you, amma, and myself i only say if i mean, cz i love you all heartfully and just like i dont lie myself i dont lie to you<br>and truly heartfully mean it what i said it all to you<br><br>

    <i>* You remembered that I said you 'i will take care of you like your mother'.. do you read our old chats? </i><br>
    the thing where start to takecare of me like my mother do and that day you said all many things in around 2am may , i dont need to read cz all the words you said heartfully are always stay in my heart<br>
    and you know when im alone,  when i feel lonely i use to listen to your songs, and sometimes i re-call this like what you said, it even bring tears, and did you remeber what you asked me after few of this words<br>
    "will you mother can love as her daughter" i said you even more than that im sure of it. but that time you said i have a surprise but still you didn't presented me that surprise<br>
    bad bad girl<br><br><br>

    <i>* Hey don't say things which you don't mean it !</i><br>
    if i don't mean i wouldn't even thinking of it, but if i choose to i will not give up, even what i have to do for, how far i go ,i will not give up<br><br>

<i>Why you say such.. and I was thinking we should stop talking this way , and leave this a things here. Let's end this, it may not work out and I kind of feel like you will hurt me ..</i>
<br>
sorry if i said anything wrong way<br>
please let me what what kind of things i still posing like i may hurt you, i will change myself,<br>
and for me, as i promised you all the time even if i get hurt of anything what it is, 'i will never hurt you', and i don't know where i'm still being wrond, that what make you think i may hurt you<br>
whatever please let me know i'll definietly stop being that way<br>
im sure im fuly sure about it<br> but ont thing is realy i can heartfully say, i may choose to kill myself rather that hurting you. <br>
and don't how a person can think of hurting mother and peroson mother like to them in life<br><br>

<br>

<i>* don't mind or don't be sad by what I am saying, actually I am really hurt these days my classmates are mean to me,

oiii how you are doing konichiva<br>
🙄 are you still anger on me 👉👈<br>
sorry for the late i had did<br>
🙄agaain today i missed train, i catched one at 8PM + then bite then came home around 9PM<br>
<br>

oiii its been 8 days you didn't yes or no for my question about my team name : what it mean by "MLOB-1"<br>
MLOB-1 is my team name and im leader of it,now im gonna reveal answer, MLOB-1 means : <br>
<b>My Only Lady Bug - Only 1</b>
<br>
how is it ...?<br><br>

👉👈 you know what, 🙄 i love the way you send me those messages like asking the way ,whether did i loose intrest something like that<br>
if you still anger on me for late keep it that way😁 <br>
its something adorable ,im still laughing sometimes after seeing that messages <br>
🤣 some gf from fan girl 🤣🤣🤣<br>
while im waiting for next train im alone in the station, i started reading that again i took a pic of it, i started laughing by imaging your face<br>
did you fell jealous of my fan girls😏<br>
😅 sorry sorry just kidding<br>
huh!!!<br>
i want to make other girls jealous of my women not my stupid jealous of others<br>
oiii,  you didn't said me to stop talking to anyone, i choose it and the way so its my way to not talk talk or not being friend with them<br>
rather than being friend with other girls i love to be alone in my way, here im saying alone cz most are crossing limits while boys and girls around me thats why im only chooose to being myself and focus on sucess for our future<br>
im still want to say the same " whenver or what thing you feel wrong way from mine just let me know it clear i will put myself away from it and change"<br>
<br>
one thing i can say heartfully, i can't imagine a life without you, i will not allow myself to cheat, betray or even hurting you i will not let myself go this way. i will always keep myself pure for you<br>  
👉👈 cz i love you a lot more like i love myself and i don't allow me to lie to myself<br>
when i started swimming its me and the ocean for my shore, attempt to abond is like going down in ocean to kill myself.<br>
i will not loose my path toward light in the dark road<br>
when i start feel like you are my half, from that day i choose to stay pure no matter what, i never let any girl come in my mind other than you. i will always be this way<br>
but i still love the you asked those question, and don't hesitate to ask when you feel that way. cz you have all rights to ask the information or things you wanna know im always ready to submit myself to my women.<br><br>
oii hinata ,  👉👈 love you so much good night...<br>
