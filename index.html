its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
“To love without condition, to talk without intention,
to give without reason, care without expectation,
“Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
“It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
“If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
“Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
"If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
“A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
“There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
“I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
“I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
“Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
“The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
“Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
“Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>

konichiwa Mitsuha chan ^-^<br>

<i>*What you feel in your heart? What you mean?</i><br>
before i answer this question, i want to know something from you. so, tell me how you feel when you open the letter i send to you by penom<br>
i don't know still you get the answer or not, in my words that feel is something like, a warm feel in heart times whenever i think of you, after a little pray to god from soul for you to be safe without even noticing.<br>
it kind of feel like whenever a girl approach near to me it push me back a step to be in my boundaries, <br>
a kind of feel, even after seeing couple around still bring a smile from inside to keep remind my always beside me in soul , a magical feel can't be expressed in words.<br>
a kind of feel, when about to feel tired and hard about studies it made me remeber and say the amound of time waste you do now is the amound of time disneyland trip moving forward.<br>
the feel, it always say to live a truthful life even the world around is rotten, being pure is just a self gifted wish amd a lot more which can't be expressed in words. and in more time made us understand how beautiful it is...<br>
<br>
<i>*Okay then let me see how you will earn my trust!☠️</i><br>
i guess i don't need to do anything special/magical to earn your trust, just like all the time going in a right path is good ^-^<br><br>
<i>* I don't think I can be a motivator for anyone, I am just interested in earning some handful of money with 50% of profit 🤷🏻‍♀️</i><br>
you know what, we dont know what our actions do sometimes, like sometimes its a normal thing for us to do but in some mind it just a goden shine to wake up and to start to move toward dreams<br>
example: did i said you this? after i show off a guy name 'pavan' my senior become friend with me and he one who started walk with me in college route from few days one day he said he inspired by me a lot and purchased a laptop to start to build his core skills, best part he stopped caring about girls around him😂😂😂 still asking me how to be in selfcontrol😂😂<br>
i lost my mind after this just like you not knowing that you inspired and motivated me without even knowing, so in theory you the one who motivated this guy 🤔🤔🤔 youre the one who behind everything ...<br>
potato chan... you are my hero, my sweet potato 😋<br><br>
<i>*Maybe you getting sick because you bath after  you go home after the full day of hardwork, so do a thing,

        <i>*Hey , you know what there are so many things left to let you know about my current life situation which going on ..... 
            Remember after navratri I wasn't texting for more few days it was because 
            I went on family with my parents, we went to Assam and Mahalaya by car, and came home at 31st October</i><br>
            ohh wow, i guess it might a little refreshment for you, at navarathri time i thought due to daily pooja and all you didn' got time to text.<br>
            and the things, say me when possible and as long as you are safe and happly thats a happy thing for me...<br>
            <br>

            <i>*You see this same in one year only we went to oddisa at March and Assam and Mahalaya at October, from small I have been traveling 80% of India's beauty I have seen .. now only few places left and some of the places I want to revisit with you like (Kashmir, Andaman, Mumbai, etc) it would be so much fun isn't it!
                And the whole world is left , hehe</i><br>
                sure😊 im definitely ready to roam all the places with you, its so  fun and lot more unexpressable. sure lets revisit the places what you want to, and there i can get a non stop adorable speaker who explain everything to me isn't it<br><br>

                <i>*By the way I just checked out you YouTube channel, you have so less viewers and almost no likes , I have and I idea for you channel to go famous you have to do some changes, wait let me write and then explain you , ok ? Will you do it as I say about your YouTube channel? And don't get offended it I say anything ok!</i>
<br>
for now this channel is only for you and i planning if i get chance i'll try to make content again, and happy to know i gonna get suggestion and all from you ^-^<br>
im waiting for you to say and oii dont rush take your time its not an emergency<br>
<br>
<i>*By the way your videos are prove enough that those pictures were take by you .. you have a great voice but you need to work on you accent and pronunciation ok ! I like the way you speak tho!</i><br>
arigato <br>
oi you know actually while im filming there are so many people out there, aside reels making candidated, commenting guys, in between all shy candy me.,, huh.. moreover i manage to made video out of shyness in public in day time with voice for the first time to show you, from next i'll try better<br><br>

<i>*Your transformation is so cool like really looking so handsome (it is more like 🔥 hot) but I liked you even before the transformation you know. Your determination and improvement is mind blowing. Keep it up. I will cheer for you . I WISH I COULD BE LIKE YOU 🥺
    Kakkoi !</i>
<br>
arigato im going shy over and over by your words 👉👈   <br>
oiii why to be like me when i love you a lot lot more when you are the way you are, you are my lucky charm ^-^<br>and you know what you are the best always its you<br>
love yourself, be yourself. the way you are, the most most beautiful and precious thing to me in the world<br>
My lucky charm<br> you are the best always<br><br>

<i>*I still don't believe it you are so much better than me, such so amazing person and you treat me so kindly the way I always want to feel valued 😭 why would you even like or love a person like me. I am so immature, no time sense, I don't understand what people want, always disturb them, oh ! Am not even that is preety, I've health issues. I am no where near perfect .  You don't even know why you love me .. what the fish is in water! 
    Sometimes my existence becomes a question.</i><br>
    for you it might be this way, but when come to me, you aren't an choice. i always feel and see you like you are the option exist in life for me, im heartfully thank everyday god while praying you to be safe happy and healthy...<br>
    you saying perfect,  so tell me what made you imperfect, if you ask me about perfection, i will say perfect word is a lie,<br>
    you aren't immature, you mature more enough to be a wise women, you are just childish, my cute little kid. and i love the way you things so much<br>
    why health issue a reason to not love a person, if you have health i'll take care of you like my own daughter, i guess those may be a way god put to make more love and understanding between each other in some cases. i still remember the day seeing you hand that way out of patches, that time what i wished god is, 'please make her healthy and happy , i'll do fasting for every saturday, as long as i could' 👉👈 this is one of reason why i refuse to agree to you when you said "dont do fasing in october"<br>
    you know what sometimes my thoughts goes like this, do my mom need to have a reason to love me, does he have any reason to love me unconditionally, then i asked the same toward me., i understood loving without expecting anything might be the happiest things ever to soul in this world.<br><br><br>

    <i>*Plus the things my perents said about stupid female being trapped by male all over the country and the sale them and use them to earn like pros etc ..... 
         The cruel world, so you know what I am actually afraid of. Oh I feel weird.. but I still have this strong feeling for you  
         some what I feel you are perfect and true huMan being .
        * never mind whatever  I said . Sorry, if you upset or offended.. Gomen ne🙇🏻‍♀️</i><br>
        arey stupid why to say sorry, did i ever get upset by you, you have all the rights to question me straight, and i should definitely answer you.<br>
        sometimes im feel so happy that your parents teach you things which make aware to go outside, cz this world really messed up, where my side few week back an incident about a girl i said you, their parents leave her to her freedom not caring much, she started being fiends with her school boys, but things went wrong. the four of her friends whom she trust killed her cruelly that so painful to say<br>
        im so glad about this with your parents, in other words its a luck, in  some of their behaviour its not.<br>
        whatover i wish and pray you to be always safe,<br>
        please be safe at outside, <br>
        huh!!! you know sometimes i feel to bite you when you say things like, stop acting kind, -_-<br>
        remeber this, if you attempt to say this when im infront of you, i dont know where i bite you, i dont gonna show any hetisation. after you question 😅😅😅<br><br>
        so keep in mind and be cafeful ok...<br>
        <br>
