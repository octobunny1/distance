its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
“To love without condition, to talk without intention,
to give without reason, care without expectation,
“Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
“It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
“If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
“Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
"If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
“A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
“There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
“I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
“I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
“Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
“The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
“Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
“Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>

when after tool use new chat and start asking for each topic simple explination, key points summary and it even provide unlimited resource also. just give a try on you acess<br>
<br>
<i> And stop writing a novel.. I even have to reply you, so think of me also.. so now I will read all but reply to few (I am not ignoring any) and don't say things which is not important or useful.. 
    and focus more on yourself and improvement then others </i><br>

    from now on i'll try to follow as you say<br><br>

    <i>Have you received the second part of that employebility skills?  (Unit 2 self mannagement skills)</i><br>
    yess yess i received, im gonna study this unit 2 after exmas , from oct-3 to 0ct-7 i have exams <br>
