its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
“To love without condition, to talk without intention,
to give without reason, care without expectation,
“Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
“It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
“If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
“Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
"If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
“A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
“There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
“I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
“I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
“Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
“The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
“Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
“Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

                            hey how are you ... <br>
                            today im a little upset like... <br>
                            did you remeber in recent a highschool girl murder in your area, here something like that happended this week in AP<br>
                            a girl in class 11, she got proposed by 4 guys and she accepted 1 and another became her brother in that<br>
                            she trusted, her bf took her to out somewhere. here the four persons planned something and kidnapped her this way<br>
                            tourcherd her few days shaved her head in half and hanged her and thrown into well<br>
                            before she got kidnapped a person sawn and complained but in end police said her family to compromise and leave<br>
                            huh! this cruelly messed up world, some politics made ruin the justice for her <br>
                            after knowing about this my mind got some raged and i long long back i know that girl she use to call me brother i guess in class 5 times i met her in summer holidays<br>
                            after that i never, i guess may be shes that sister <br>
                            the cruel, the trash of 4 not get punished, due to politics<br>
                            this messed up world...<br><br><br>

                            in other side i said you about the competetion right, i do done all my work and my presentation document and my Team name is <b>MOLB-O1</b><br>
                            this morning i asked my college one of office staff, did he made the college submittion's he said he forgot and his behaviour so reckless and rude<br>
                            he asked me ' are you thinking you are intellegent than me, dont tell me what to do. '<br>
                            his shown so much ego and a bad attitude towards me and few seniors said he's such a bad attitude person and not responsible<br>
                            🙄 i tried to break his ego ... by saying 'if its come to responsibility, that competetion is important to me,,, as long as we you make it late
                             i may choose to take my step. im leaving this to you cz of your position and i still hold some respect.' and then i left, but that person still didnt made the submission <br>
                            and 28th september is last date for it<br>
                            so i contacted my class teacher then my class teacher said, 'its not new to our existed staff, about that persons way'<br>
                            then knowing that incident <br>
                            <br>
                             i worked all a part full weak building two projects out reaching my logics, but this person...<br>
                             🙄 sorry if i said wrong here, im a little, not a little some level of messed up, <br>
                             then or now i only have you to share my things , and i promised you if i had a bad day or any i will not hide it <br>
                             dont mind if i talked any wrong way, i tried my best to leave the situtaion but that person. tested my patience<br>
                             i'll try to not do like this again, today i went this cz another reason is this competition only comes once a year and waited a whole year for it now it getting out of hand due to some ego ist's attude and irresponsibility<br>
                             🙄 now im going to sleep <br>
                             forgive me if i did anywrong<br><br>

                             <hr>

                               but few teams are full of girls<br>
                               in my team 2 sisters are there <br>
                               1- priya<br>

                                now its 28-09-2023 : 10:25PM <br>
                                i guided a team from another section also from 25 i guess, two Sister from another section said they like my voice, and they said im kind<br>
                                 remeber sometimes you used to say im acting like angel and something -_- something... one sister from the two of another section, said she would like to be my friend and she sawn none like me <br>
                                 and i asked what the point now sister im only here to guide your team <br>she said why you always using word sister when i have a good name, so use it instead why cant we be good friends or maybe best frinds<br><br>
                                 <b> here i started recorder in phone for safety,  minding previous incident in train back then</b><br>
                                 i replied as when this competetion come to an end, till then i will do guide team as i said to the mentor, when it end my role will also end so its better for you to hold there.<br>
                                 she asked  me :  do i have a gF and where she live<br>
                                 i replied : 'yes i do' and she live a little far from here<br>
                                 she asked : name and where 'she(you) is from'<br>
                                 i said :  its none of your business<br>
                                 she talked a little bad here: like why can't we be just friends only friends, there is nothing wrond <br>
                                 i said, i better for you to hold your thoughts there if you go far, i dont care about this competetion. i'll quit next minute in reason im not intrested in both of teams<br>
                                she again said the same: so no one know and for just friends nothing wrong and dont worry n0-one can say it to her, and there nothing wrong to be friends/best friends isn't it?<br>
                                i said her : Sister! its not about the way you think, and she's not the person like you to perform the same way way you presented here, and i dont like to be friend with you, not even you not my team mates or even my class and even who im call sister,... its my responsibility to deliver more than my girl give to me and even more .and in more i love her so much, so i guess you understood so will you please leave... <br>
                                That sister called me a Cold after that <br><br>
                                i asked :her, sister do you have BF<br>
                                she said : yes.and he's in other colleged far away from here<br>
                                i asked : if that so, don't you it's wrong  for you, <br>
                                she said : i'm feeling loneliness so to avoid feeling im making friends <br>
                                i asked : why can't it be from girls .<br>
                                she : make a weird face and and said, exactly as i guess you really an innocent and too good. its just a time pass and i dont know what he do there<br>
                                i replied : is that no its none of my business, and thanks for waste of time.<br><br>
                                 - when im about to leave - 
                                 <br>
                                 she said : don't you think youre girl be this way, and even she not even living close to your place just like my guy did<br>
                                 i replied : A while ago i said you, now also saying listen carefully... she's not a girl like you, she is a real women, my women and im her's only. just as i said she do the same way i do,.. and if you wanna air anywords about her, be ready to be the first girl to slap by me. till now i didn't disrepect a girl, may be if you do choose to talk any thing about my women, i will talk to your mother about this incident. you dont need to think when you start suspision to me in this conversation i sarted recording , it may not help my girl cz of the language but your mother may right. so say sorry for saying like that about my person. <br>
                                 she asked : me to delete and even said sorry also, and also said sorry to me to go that far <br>
                                 me : i deleted that infront of her. and said better know the meaning and value of trust and loyalty, and i even said sorry also <br>
                                 she : she called me a B**ch -_- <br>
                                 i replied : its a waste of time for me . i dont time to argue to you sister, Know your place <br>

                                 <b> and i left the place immediately</b><br><br>
                                 But you know, 🙄 that person talked so bad in last "Slang...". and no one there when conversation come to end, and she used a little slang words after i deleted <br>
