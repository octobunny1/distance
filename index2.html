its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
    “To love without condition, to talk without intention,
     to give without reason, care without expectation,
    “Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
    “It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
    “If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
    “Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
    "If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
    “A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
    “There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
    “I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
    “I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
     “Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
    “The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
     “Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
     “Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

    how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>

i woke up at 9:30 am then exercise and rest... <br>
just now i have read those from <br>
<i>Hey read this it's from bhagvat gita and Mahabharata.... Another sacred holy book same as Bible </i><br>
those you wrote are really amazing and meaningfull i read twice each the describing was amazing clear to understand in other words what i understand in all of that is <br>
we have two options in a sort of choices based on we whose <br>
- Adopt, move , go as far as you can to win ( every force has a oppose reaction, that mean if you work you will see result if you sit without working you will only the time passing to dead line)<br>
in the end its win/loose all depends on how you chooose to take in path .<br> and you know one of teacher said a line in first class from mahabhatay -- its goes like : "yata tadaina tada tadesta , by krishna" something like this line <br>
where god said do what you wanna do just do, at certain point result will appear all its depends on the desire honesty and dedication of the path of action in the end Karma the thing stay to declare the result<br>
<br>
that time i feel so excite something those are amazing right!!<br>
then in end of class my teacher said , "im none to command you, even krishna said to arjuna what you wanna do i'll stay by side of truth, then how a person can comand you as teacher": that time i found that he is the best teacher i had found , now that teacher helping we to improve  my skills to reach out of box <br>
his name is : Satish Aisthey - he teach java : but for him i am his co-doveloper in projects ^-^<br><br> i wanna see and more like that from you they are so meanig full to know <br>

<br>
and oii when sending me message select option to keep or clear the previous<br>
