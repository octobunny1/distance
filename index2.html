its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
    “To love without condition, to talk without intention,
     to give without reason, care without expectation,
    “Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
    “It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
    “If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
    “Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
    "If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
    “A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
    “There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
    “I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
    “I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
     “Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
    “The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
     “Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
     “Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

           <i>Wow, it is pretty amazing that you know and have the idea of Mahabharata,, 
            well at class 7 I was a true devotee of Mahabharata I used to see the series of it and read the bani Krishna gave and listen to bhajans of it..
             I was too addicted 😅 not just that when I was in in junior high class 4 I remembered I wanted to Marry Krishna and before that also I remembered I wore a red vermilion as a sign married to Krishna 😐 that was to much right.. 
              well I still do like the fact that I was crazy enough to do so ..
              and there were many reasons behind it, but I was silly back then
            And have happy Ganesh chaturthi
            Nice that you used to celebrate it,
             and it's starting from tommoro 19th, today it was bhishakarma Pooja (God of iron and steel and vehicles) </i><br>
             not that much knowledge about Mahabharata, its like im favourite student for my Language teacher(telugu) while im in school she used to tell me mahabharata stories often when im and mam are free and you know she use to gave me so many tomatoes on my head like my mother 😅 <br>
             but you made it incredible by saying want to marry krishna... but its adorable same time 😆😆😆 <br>
             i dont have much idea about bhishakarma  😅 <br>

                                         my father was was saying the day they found out I was talking to some stranger about my problem,
                                          said he that "If he is your boyfriend and if he loves you 
                                          then ask him money for the 12 examination and admission in NID" 
                                          I said that "he is not my boyfriend just close friends and I said if I say he will but he is still a student not a employer"
                                           my father was a bit offended and shock but I was kind of confus and have doubt what I just said.
                                            My father said if he will or not then let's check, send your bank account and say him to pay ,
                                            if he really loves you like we do then he will pay this huge" I was quite then.. 
                                            and my father ended by saying "if in future you choose to disobey me and marry someone out of religion and cast
                                             then I will think my daughter is not there, we will not have any short of connection, 
                                        and if your mother wants to talk her I will not let "....</i><br>

                                        and you know this made me think so well about myself, and maybe if something like that he said me to pay, i may ask him to loan me.
                                        and ill say to pay it back with intrest once i stand<br> dont worry about anything just have faith and beliefs <br>
