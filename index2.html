its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
    “To love without condition, to talk without intention,
     to give without reason, care without expectation,
    “Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
    “It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
    “If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
    “Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
    "If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
    “A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
    “There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
    “I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
    “I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
     “Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
    “The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
     “Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
     “Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

<i>How is your progress going on ... On your studies , your language English, Hindi... And your fitness.... 
    Prepare yourself for every situation worst or best no matter what...
     Everything always have a solution, to the key is ourselves only </i>
     <br>
more or less everything is going fine<br>
and my studies they are well, 3 of my teachers started enouchourage me to excel in my skills<br>
language  im practicing 3 times in a week due to college work and schedules they left me no time cz, i changed from electronics to computers in 2nd year so i need to came up with all 1st year in just a month 😅😅<br>
my fitness 😎😎😎 im the strongest 😊 , wait to see the 6packs😎<br><br>
yess i understood and im gonna prepare myself in every situation, no matter what im gonna give up <br>
<br> you know what you said me to socialize 🙄<br>
i tried but it endup trash in my mind, in beginning i though to make friends in class and in college<br>
and you know it right as i said im not gonna friend with a girl or not even gaonna talk, im standing well <br>
while i friends with few boys in my class when im i sit with them in a conversation, in a row of 3 days i didnt listen a good word from their mouth<br>
all they talking bad about everygirl or even about female teachers<br> i left the group then that movement <br>
i took solo leveling myself in college that mean im a team myself😅<br>
and hey you know i only found one person from another class his name is "harsha" a good person he observed me in train that day<br>
yesterday ha came to talk to me and he is the only one i found seeing and respecting girls as own sisters, he is an introvert too😅<br>
but sometimes(rarely) he getting bullied, now that person and i got to be friends but he is from another department in college and we use to talk so rare 😅 introverts😅<br>
but this world outside is so trash like, even more worse that trash, no-one is trustable, no-one is loyal most is filled with trash in mind and mostly chance takers to ward females,
 i guess you understand what trash im saying about<br> and afterall i guess its better for me to stay scilent rather that try to being friends<br>
 huh!! i may not a fully introvert, but now i choosed to be anti-social whatever it is, its been 2 days i opened my mouth to talk😅<br>
 going to college study coming the same way without noice is so peaceful. its feeling so well when minding self<br>
 but the outside trash before maintaining afairs they can't even thinking of their parents and they even trying to drag innocents into it<br>
 this is the only reason i choosed mainly to be anti-social<br><br>
 im heartfully saying my thank to god for making you, from tommorow with health and safety im gonna add my thanks in the fasting in every saturday🥰<br>
be safe and mindful, this outside world fully rotten<br> when you going outside even with parents stay concious and be aware the trash outside is so cursed<br>
<br>afterall being anti-social not gonna effect my communicatins skills, cz the 3 teachers and the friend in train i may prace good communication with their help<br>
and now im gonna enter another level in learning bengali <br> ushhh!!! its a surprise<br><br>
<br><br>
so tomorrow is competition right <br>
all the best my potato do your best you are the best , stay calm and do your best<br>
for now good night dont stay wake up all night okay!! sleep well and earlly<br>
turn left and take me close 🙄... close to your heart beat... <br>pamper me thses trash i sawn in 3 days scareed me out<br>
but im not gonna stop, i'll keep moving forward toward our goals and dreams<br>
im not gonna give up no matter what and how the world is im not gonna step back myself not gonna break my promises or even my words<br>
im gonna do even more better in study on further and update myself<br>
i believe, <br> simply as like every day, im gonna wake up pray, college home study pray and sleep.<br>
im not gonna give up no matter how hard it is im gonna stand on my every words<br><br><hr>
good night/good morning <br>
you are the best<br>
dont forget 10 bottles of water , eat well and sleeo 7+ <br>
if you try to stay awake till midningth, dont forget this ghost is not innocent 😑, this black cat gonna remember as like you remember this "🤮" and then...... <br>
😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋<br>
so i guess you gonna choose to sleep early right <br><br>
else🤨🤨🤨🤨... i...😋😋😋😋<br><br><hr>good night my sweet potato😋<br><br> all the very best for your competetion do your best you are the best<br><br>
