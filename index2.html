its truly beautiful isn't it... when <b>he</b> said .....
<br><b> <i style="color:aliceblue;">
    “To love without condition, to talk without intention,
     to give without reason, care without expectation,
    “Love is nurtured by trust, respect, and understanding.” that's the spirit of true love.”<br><br>
    “It is a love that is beyond the physical, and it is a love that is spiritual. It is a love that is eternal.” <br><br>
    “If you really love that person, learn to wait. Maybe you are not meant to be together today, but meant to be in the future.” <br><br>
    “Love is the energy that binds souls together.” <br><br>
    "If you want to understand love, don’t use your eyes. Open your inner eyes because the truth is not associated with beauty. It’s related to emotion."<br><br>
    “A man is made by his beliefs. As he believes. So he becomes.” <br><br>
    “There are three gates to self-destruction and hell: Lust, Anger & Greed.”<br><br>
    “I have a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggle, and a reward for your faithfulness. Trust me and don’t give up.” <br><br>
    “I regard as great even the smallest gift offered by my devotees in pure love, but even great offerings presented by non-devotees do not please me.”<br><br>
     “Blessed is a human birth, even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth, for true knowledge and pure love may be attained only by a human being.”<br><br>
    “The Key to happiness is the reduction of desires.”<br><br>
     “Do everything you have to do, but not with ego, not with lust, not with envy but with love, compassion, humility, and devotion.” <br><br>
     “Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.” <br><br>

    how beautiful it is to listen to that person krishna, how amazing feel it give us when we made up ourselves to follow those words... <br></i>
